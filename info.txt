For Deployment on GitHub Pages:

    Build and Deploy:
        When you run yarn build or npm run build, CRA will compile your application into a build directory. This directory becomes the root of your website.
        The contents of this build directory should be deployed to your GitHub Pages site. If you use the gh-pages package (yarn deploy), it handles this process for you.
